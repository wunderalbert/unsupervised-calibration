# Quantification

This is a Python implementation of Unsupervised Recalibration and experiments benchmarking it against standard quantification algorithms.

Contents:
  - `quantification`: a small package implementing the quantification algorithms and methods for generating artificial data sets,
  - `experiments`: Python scripts that can be used to reproduce our quantification experiments,
  - `analyses`: Jupyter Notebooks used to generate plots summarizing the CSV files generated by the experiments.
