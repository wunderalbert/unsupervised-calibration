# Experiments

This directory contains the quantification experiments described in [Unsupervised Recalibration](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.09157).

List of files:
  - `example.py` – a simple experiment presenting how to use the code.
  - `balanced-training.py` – in this experiment the training data set is balanced, while the test data set is unbalanced.
  - `balanced-training-max.py` – this experiment repeats the above one, except that is optimizes EM and URC for longer time.
  - `balanced-test.py` – in this experiment the test data set is balanced, while the training data set is unbalanced.
  - `balanced-test-max.py` – this experiment repeats the above one, except that is optimizes EM and URC for longer time.
